# How GitHub Uses GitHub - Writing documentation for your projects

## Introduction
- Matt Desmond, Trainer at GitHub, previous experience as a technical writer
- Eric Holscher, Founder Read|Write the Docs

## Why Document

- Personally, if I begin using a new application or framework and I can't find documentation to either get started or utilize the functionality, I move on to other options.

## Why use GitHub for Documentation

- I came from a world where I had 6 versions of the same Word file with -FINAL, -FINAL-For-Real, -FINAL-DATE, and FINAL-DATE-NO-REALLY for almost every project
- Sharing the documentation process 

## Looking at Documentation

- Read the Docs repo: https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org
- Read the Docs documentation: https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html

- Q for Eric during webcast: Being involved with Read and Write the Docs, I would imagine you have seen your fair share of documentation, what do you think are your top 3 dos and 3 donts when it comes to documents?
- "perfect segue into getting started"

## Getting Started with Documentation

- Installation instructions
- Open source repository? Include how to contribute instructions
- Focus on consistent phrasing and making things easy to find

### Consider the Audience
- Keep content for specific end-users grouped
- Don't assume that your audience comes with any knowledge

### Know what / when to document
- Not _everything_ needs to be documented
  - Examples of what not to document

- Understand why you documenting something    
- Don't create FAQs (https://content-guide.18f.gov/structure-the-content/#dont-use-faqs)

## Publishing Documentation

- GitHub Pages 
- Read the Docs 
  - Eric: if you could provide a brief description of the process of getting documentation published on the RtDs platform here that would be awesome

## How to get community help with documentation?

- Not every open source contributor is ready to provide contributions to the code of your application. 
   - Identify documentation requirements and create issues with "beginner friendly" or "good first issue" labels
     - Q for Eric during the webcast: How many issues with a "good first issue" label do you think gets resolved by a new contributor to the Read the Docs repository?
     - Q for Eric during the webcast: How do you encourage newcomers to the Read the Docs repository to contribute?
